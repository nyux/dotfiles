# Nyux's Dotfiles + Configs

I've spent way too many hours configuring settings after an OS wipe, or a shoddy `rm` command. //_> This is to make sure that my settings're backed up in one place, and also to make it easy to share them with others.


## Configs to add:

* .gitconfig
* .weechat folder, w/ personal info scrubbed out
* .vimrc

## Plans?

An install script is on the horizon, either written in bash or ruby.

Just found <http://dotfiles.github.com/>, and will be looking through it. Need to decide if I want to run bash-it, or oh-my-zsh.

Also plan to segregate files by OS, since my time will be split between Arch and OS X, with a debian system on backup if strictly necessary.

## Files currently stored:

* .bashrc
* .bash_aliases
* .Xdefaults
* .screenrc
