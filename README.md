# Dotfiles + Configs

This repo is meant as a backup for all my significant dotfiles and configs for bash, urxvt, and i3, to prevent them from getting lost across installs. Still a huge work in progress, that gets better in bursts. i3 configs were forked from [this github repo](https://github.com/NorthAntrim/i3-config) and then modified to suit my tastes.

The configs are no longer geared towards supporting both Linux and OS X, which takes out some verbosity in the `.bashrc`. A few files have also been re-ordered to flow better, and have better semantic meaning.

To take advantage of all the functionality here, install `lesspipe` and `python2-pygments`.

Eventually, there'll be a script to automate making/deleting symlinks from dotfiles to home.
